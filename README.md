# BRAND-LOGO-DETECTOR
Developing an image classifier using TensorFlow which classifies the given image correctly to the category it belongs to. The images are of the brand logos Adidas, Nike, Puma, and Reebok.
LOGO DETECTOR


Logo recognition in images and videos is the key problem in a wide range of applications, such as copyright infringement detection, vehicle logo for intelligent traffic-control systems, augmented reality, contextual advertisement placement and others. Logo detection along with Logo localisation are to be implemented in such cases. This is done by a single forward pass in a deep neural network.

There are three main methods for object detection:
Deep Convolutional Neural Network
Single Shot Multibox Detector(SSD)
You Only Look Once(YOLO)

Here we are using the Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks, trained with ImageNet architecture using Tensorflow. Also, Transfer learning technique is used since it shortcuts much of the huge dataset by taking a piece of a model that has already been trained on a related task and reusing it in a new model.
